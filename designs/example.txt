Simple cotton shirt {ID shirt, ordernumber 6, dye blue} [[[Item List Note]]]

This shirt is a simple garment constructed from cotton allowing for protection
from the various elements but still allowing for breathability. A broad
circular collar encircles the wearer's neck and shoulders, having been
embroidered in a simplistic chain pattern out of thread of the same color as
the rest of the shirt. Long sleeves end in similar cuffs at the wrist. The
shirt hangs down to the waist, falling just beneath the navel. This article has
been tailored to fit a wide range of wearers, including flaps that tie shut in
the back to accommodate wings as needed.
