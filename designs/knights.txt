Armsman bracers {bracers, ordernumber 7, dye red}

Spanning from wrist to forearm, these bracers are made of supple, comfortable
maroon leather to allow ease of movement. Embroidered with stitching
reminiscent of bared blades, this signifier of rank is left unadorned with
tassel or stud. Though too thin to serve as armor, the armsman's bracers could
easily be the breaker of many a nose.

Crimson lion caparison {caparison, ordernumber 11, dye black}

The treated woolen cloth you see before you rests comfortably on this
individual's equine form, draping over the back, sweeping down the cannon of
the legs. The pattern of the caparison boasts colors of dark crimson and onyx,
with a handful of circular golden buttons trailing from where the torso meets
the withers, to the bottom hem. There is a fearsome lion embroidered into the
center of the chest in crimson thread. To match the emblems is a depiction of a
kite shield sewn into one side of the caparison, with a similar image of a lion
nestled in the center that signifies this person as a member of the Order of
the Crimson Lion.

The tabard can be sold to any Garrison member.
```

Crimson lion tabard {ID tabard, ordernumber 4, dye black}

The billowing panels of onyx-hued cotton that make for this tabard lay over the
shoulders with open sides, allowing the arms to move freely as they please.
Supple leather forms the belt that wraps around the person's waist, with an
unobtrusive silver buckle fastening the piece in place to allow the remaining
fabric of the tabard to flow freely down and brush against the thighs. Noble in
its design, a fearsome lion is embroidered into the center of the chest in
crimson thread. The heraldic lion's mane is ruffled majestically around its
head as its eyes stare out to the front of the tabard.
